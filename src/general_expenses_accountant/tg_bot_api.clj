;; AVAILABLE METHODS

(defn build-immediate-response
  "From the Telegram Bot API docs: \"If you're using webhooks, you can perform
   a request to the Bot API while sending an answer to the webhook ... Specify
   the method to be invoked in the 'method' parameter of the request.\".

   An example of an immediate request that the Telegram API is able to handle:

   {:method \"sendMessage\",
    :chat_id chat-id,
    :reply_to_message_id msg-id,
    :text \"An ordinary reply message text.\"}

   This technique helps to reduce the number of requests to the Bot API server
   and, as a consequence, reduces the response time of the client's UI."

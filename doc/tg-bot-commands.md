UX guidelines and tips for bot commands.


## Command prompts

In BotFather, you may specify the command prompts for your bot. This is done by calling the `/setcommands` command.
The command prompts will be displayed when typing a `/` (slash) in any chat with your bot.

- If prompts have been added, next to the _"Send"_ button, a button may appear that opens the bot commands menu.
This feature is optional and client-specific.

- If the command prompts contain `/help`, the _"Help"_ button appears in the bot profile actions.
Clicking the button sends this command.

- If the command prompts contain `/settings`, the _"Settings"_ button appears in the bot profile actions.
Clicking the button sends this command.
